# 3. Learn the basics

Now as riven is up and running, let's have some fun and start writing! In this chapter
you'll learn the basics and how to use Riven to generate PDFs.

However if you're looking for an good example: You're reading one! This documentation
is generated with riven. You can read the markdown source code at the
[doc directory](https://github.com/phortx/riven/blob/master/doc/) in the GitHub
repository of riven. The
[generated PDF](https://github.com/phortx/riven/blob/master/doc/riven.pdf) can be found
in that directory too.

If you want to learn markdown you should take a look at the
[Learn Markdown book from GitBook](https://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/markdown/content/)
which can be read online.
