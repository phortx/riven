## 3.1. A single file

Let's start small and transform a single file into your first beautiful PDF!

Create a new markdown file where ever you want and name it `awesome.md`. Put some markdown into the file just like this:

```markdown
# Hello World!

**This** is my first Riven generated PDF!
```

Now we compile the PDF with a simple Riven call:

```bash
$ riven awesome.pdf
```

You should get a PDF file called `awesome.pdf`. Open it and admire your first PDF.
