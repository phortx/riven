## 1.1. Scenario A: You want to write a book

You are a bit familiar with Linux or OSX. Maybe you even know what markdown is, but it's okay if you don't know markdown.
And you want to write a book for some reason. Maybe a subject book, maybe a novel or maybe some fanfiction for whatever
you like. But you have no idea of LaTeX and you don't want to write it in LibreOffice or some other kind of office
suite for some reason. Maybe because you want to have full control over all formatings and you love a text editor like
atom, sublime editor or vim. You also know HTML and CSS maybe, but you don't want to use it since it's to much code to
write and you have to test to it too often in you browser while writing.

What you want is just a very simple and lean tool chain which let's you write a very minimalistic markup in your
favorite text editor and compiles everything in a beautiful, readable and stylish PDF (and mobi, epub etc in the
future). And if something doesn't fit your requirements, you just change it via CSS or configuration.
