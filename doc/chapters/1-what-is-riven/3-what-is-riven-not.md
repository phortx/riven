## 1.3. What is Riven not?

Now you may have a clue what Riven is. But it's maybe even more important to understand what riven actually is **not**.
Well Riven is neither a editor like atom nor a typesetting system like TeX nor a markup language like markdown or
reStructuredText nor a office suite nor a web based service like [Lit Lift](http://www.litlift.com/) or
[Fast Pencil](http://www.fastpencil.com/). It's just a command line tool which transforms markdown files into PDF
documents (and HTML, mobi, ePub etc in the future). So it's more comparable with the
[sphinx documentation generator](http://sphinx-doc.org/).

Also Riven doesn't run on windows machines. Sorry for that.

Additionally Riven lacks some features you may know from sphinx. For example HTML site generation is not there (yet!)
and Riven is (yet!) not able to generate man pages, ePub and mobi formats. But those features are planned and will be
added in the future. Also Riven intentionally doesn't generate chapter numeration like you may know from sphinx. You
have to do it on your own (and you can just omit it if you don't like it or even mix it up). But maybe there will be an
option in the future which makes Riven to auto generate chapter numbers for you.
