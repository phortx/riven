## 1.2. Scenario B: Your a coder and want to document your software

You have a software project, you're familiar with Linux or OSX, HTML, CSS, Markdown and others. And you want to document
your software in a plain text readable format. But you also want a very simple and lean tool chain which compiles
everything in a beautiful, readable and stylish PDF (and mobi, epub etc in the future). And if something doesn't fit
your requirements, you just change it via CSS or configuration. Also you want to use your favorite text editor like atom, sublime editor or vim but don't want to write the documentation in HTML and CSS since it's to much code to write and you
have to test to it too often in you browser while writing. And you don't want to write it in LibreOffice or some other
kind of office suite for some reason. For example because you're working in a team and you're using some kind of version control system like git. Therefore a plain text format is much more beneficial then a binary blob.
